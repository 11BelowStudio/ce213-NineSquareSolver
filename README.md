# ce213-NineSquareSolver
This is the thing I made for my CE213 Artificial Intelligence assignment. Basically, it's a nine square solver that uses bidirectional breadth first search. and it go nyoom.

# what it does

so basically it just solves a 9-square puzzle with an initial state of this:
```
8 7 6
5 4 3
2 1  
```
to a goal state of this: 

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8  
```
via bidirectional breadth first search (and outputs the moves taken to get to this state to an output.txt file).

and does it pretty quickly too, which is nice.

yeah that's basically it.
